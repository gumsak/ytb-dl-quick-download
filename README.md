# ytb-dl-quick-download

`start-dl` is a Bash script used to quickly start downloading the audio from a youtube video. The script 100% relies on youtube-dl.

## Programs / Libraries required

- youtube-dl
- ffmpeg
- ffprobe
- ffplay

**Make sure all these programs are in the same directory**

## Customize the Script

You can use the script as is, or change / add whatever you need (i.e. change the destination of the downloaded files, their format : MP3, FLAC..., etc.).

## Execute the Script

You can execute the script through a Unix shell (on windows you can use the Bash from the 'Git for windows' program).

The `start-dl` script only takes one argument, the link to the youtube video:

`./start-dl.bash your_ytb_link`

## TO-DO

- [ ] Add links to referenced programs
